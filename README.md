Project Description

This Medical Calculator is a C++ application designed to calculate essential health metrics such as Body Mass Index (BMI), Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), and Daily Calorie Requirements. The application will take user input including age, height, gender, and activity level to provide accurate and personalized health information.

Features

User Inputs: Taking the following parameters (Weight, Age, Height, Gender, Activity Level) Imperial and Metric measurments will be accepted
BMI Calculator: Computes the Body Mass Index, indicating if a user is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese based on their height and weight.
BMR Calculator: Estimates the Basal Metabolic Rate, showing the number of calories the body needs at rest.
Daily Calorie Requirement Calculator: Calculates the total number of calories a user should consume in a day, based on their BMR and activity level.


Age: Used in BMR and daily calorie calculations.
Height: Required for BMI calculations.
Weight: Essential for both BMI and BMR calculations.
Gender: Impacts BMR calculation as metabolic rates differ between genders.
Activity Level: Determines the daily calorie needs. Activity levels can be categorized as sedentary, lightly active, moderately active, very active, or extra active.
How to Use

The user will be prompted to enter their age, height, weight, gender, and activity level.
Based on these inputs, the application will calculate and display the BMI, BMR, and daily calorie requirements.
The results will include interpretations, like BMI category or if the daily calorie intake is suitable for weight maintenance, loss, or gain.
